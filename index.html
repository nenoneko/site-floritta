        <h2>About</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
             <p>at floritta, we believe that flowers have the power to transform spaces and emotions. each arrangement is created with care, sensitivity, and attention to detail, 
                thinking not only about beauty, but also about the feeling it will evoke.
                we work with carefully selected flowers, harmonious combinations, and an artistic eye that values nature in its most delicate form. <br>
                whether to gift someone special, celebrate an important moment, or bring more warmth into your home, floritta exists to turn simple moments into meaningful ones.
                here, every flower tells a story. and we take care of each one as if it were unique, because we believe that small gestures can blossom into great feelings.
